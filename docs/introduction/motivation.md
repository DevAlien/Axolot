# Motivation

In the NodeJS world things change fairly quickly and some frameworks we were using just did not stick to the pace of the node ecosystem.

One of the frameworks I felt more comfortable with was [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/) I just felt confortable with and everything was working fine but we needed to update few libraries, like [socket.io](http://socket.io) and it was not easy because it was so coupled inside the framework that did not gave us the freedom to do it.

So I just created this small framework (which I intend to make bigger and better) to fit my/our needs better.
